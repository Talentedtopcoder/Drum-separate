# Drum Separation

An Python implementation of drum separation from music signals.
This project is the coursework assignment of the course SGN-14007 2019-2020 Introduction to Audio Processing, Tampere University. The audio test samples are provided by the course.

If you are interested, take a look at [our formal report of the project](https://github.com/amadeuspham/drumSeparation/blob/master/REPORT.pdf).

```

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amadeuspham/drumSeparation.git
cd drumSeparation
```

### Install dependencies

Make sure you have the following [Python](https://www.python.org) packages installed: [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), [LibROSA](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/). You can install all of them through pip by running the following command using on command line:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib librosa
```

## Usage

```bash
python Separator.py PATH-TO-MUSIC-WAV-FILE
```

For example:

```bash
python Separator.py test_samples/police03short.wav
```

The separated results will be written to folder /output, in two files: H.wav and P.wav. H.wav contains the harmnonic components of the music file, while P.wav contains the percussive components (drums).

In addition, spectrograms of the original audio file and the separated files are also drawn. Make sure that both H.wav and P.wav are still inside the ./output folder for this to be done.

### Recommended use

Due to the nature of the algorithm, which classifies continuity along y-axis in the spectrogram (frequency) as percussions, and continuity along x-axis in the spectrogram (time) as harmonics, it is recommended to only apply this algorithm on music files with little singing or pitch-varying instruments. The algorithm works well for drums and pitched instruments tracks.

### Results

Below is the power spectrum of test_samples/police03short.wav

</p>

And the two graphs below are the power spectra of harmonic-only and percussion-only audio outputs, respectively.

</p>

Comparing these spectrograms to each other, we can clearly see the harmonics (horizontal lines) in the upper spectrogram as well as the percussions (straight, vertical lines) in the lower one. This indicates a very positive performance of the algorithm on this audio sample.

## Testing

You can test the performance of the algorithm with different range compression values (y) or different number of parameters. The default test values are 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 for y and 5, 10, 20, 60, 100 for the number of iterations.

```bash
python testPerformance.py PATH-TO-MUSIC-WAV-FILE
```

For example:

```bash
python testPerformance.py test_samples/police03short.wav
```

To experiment with your own different values of y and no. iterations, open testPerformance.py, go to the last 2 lines, and add your values as a Python list or NumPy array as the second parameter of each function. Please note that 0 < y <= 1.
